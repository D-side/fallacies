## Appeal to the Mind

### Appeal to Anonymous Authority

Using evidence from an unnamed \'expert\' or \'study\' or generalized group (like \'scientists\') to claim something is true.

> \'They say that it takes 7 years to digest chewing gum.\'

### Appeal to Authority

Claiming something is true because an (a person holding authority) \'expert\' says it is.

> \'Over 4000 prominent scientists and engineers dispute global warming.\'

### Appeal to Common Practice

Claiming something is true because it\'s commonly practiced.

> \'This bank has some problems with corruption, but there\'s nothing going on here that doesn\'t go on in all other banks.\'

### Appeal to Ignorance

A claim is true simply because it has not been proven false (or false because it has not been proven true).

> \'Nobody has proven to me there\'s a God. So I know there is no God.\'

### Appeal to Incredulity

Because a claim sounds unbelievable, it must not be true.

> \'The eye is an incredibly complex biomechanical machine with thousands of interlocking parts. How could that exist without an intelligent designer?\'

### Appeal to Money

Supposing that, if someone is rich or something is expensive, then it affects the truth of the claim.

> \'If it costs more, it must be better.\'

### Appeal to Novelty

Supposing something is better because it is new or newer.

> \'Awesome! The latest version of this operating system is going to make my computer faster and better..\'

### Appeal to Popular Belief

Claiming something is true because the majority of people believe it.

> \'Milk is essential for healthy bones.\'

### Appeal to Probability

Assuming because something could happen, it will inevitably happen.

> \'There are billions of galaxies with billions of stars in the universe, so there must be another planet with intelligent life on it.\'

### Appeal to Tradition

Claiming something is true because it\'s (apparently) always been that way.

> \'The government has always existed, therefore society cannot live without one.\'

---

## Appeal to the Emotions

### Appeal to Consequences of a Belief

Arguing a belief is false because it implies something you\'d rather not believe.

> \'That can\'t be the Senator on that sex-tape. If it were, he\'d be lying about not knowing her, and he\'s not the kind of man who would lie.\'

### Appeal to Fear

An argument is made by increasing fear and prejudice towards the opposing side.

> \'Before you know there will be more mosques than churches.\'

### Appeal to Flattery

Using an irrelevant compliment to slip in an unfounded claim which is accepted along with the compliment.

> \'Intelligent and sophisticated readers will of course recognize a fallacy like this when they read one.\'

### Appeal to Nature

Making your claim seem more true by drawing a comparison with the \'good\' natural world.

> \'Of course homosexuality is unnatural. You don\'t see same-sex animals copulating.\'

### Appeal to Pity

Attempt to induce pity to sway opponents.

> \'The former dictator is an old, dying man. It\'s wrong to make him stand trial for these alleged offenses.\'

### Appeal to Ridicule

Presenting the opponent\'s argument in a way that makes it appear absurd.

> \'Faith in God is like believing in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy.\'

### Appeal to Spite

Dismissing a claim by appealing to personal bias against the claimant.

> \'Don\'t you just hate how those rich Liberal Hollywood actors go on TV to promote their agendas?\'

### Appeal to Wishful Thinking

Suggesting a claim is true or false just because you strongly hope it is.

> \'The President wouldn\'t lie. He\'s our leader and a good American.\'

---

## Faulty Deduction

### Anecdotal Evidence

Discounting evidence arrived at by systematic search or testing in favor of a few first hand stories.

> \'I\'m going to carry on smoking. My grandfather smoked 40 a day until he died at the age of 90.\'

### Composition

Assuming that characteristics or beliefs of some of a group applies to the entire group.

> \'Recent terrorist attacks have been carried out by Islamic groups, therefore all terrorists are Muslims.\'

### Division

Assuming that characteristics or beliefs of a group automatically apply to any individual member.

> \'Many Conservatives wish to ban gay marriage, discredit climate change, and deny evolution, therefore all conservatives are homophobic, anti-environment creationists.\'

### Design Fallacy

Assuming that because something is nicely designed or beautifully visualized, it\'s more valid or better.

> \'Elementary OS is the most well designed and best looking Linux distribution, therefore it is clearly superior.\'

### Gambler\'s Fallacy

Assuming a history of independent outcomes will affect future outcomes.

> \'I\'ve flipped a coin 10 times in a row and it\'s been heads each time, therefore the next coin flip is more likely to come up with tails.\'

### Hasty Generalization

Drawing a general conclusion from a tiny sample.

> \'I just got cut off by the woman driver in front. Women can\'t drive.\'

### Jumping to Conclusions

Drawing a quick conclusion without fairly considering relevant (and easily available) evidence.

> \'She wants birth control in her medical cover? What a slut!\'

### Middle Ground

Assuming because two opposing arguments have merit, the answer must lie somewhere in between them.

> \'I rear ended your car but I don\'t think I should pay for the damage. You think I should pay for all the damage. A fair compromise would be to split the bill in half.\'

### Perfectionist Fallacy

Assuming that the only option on the table is perfect success, then rejecting anything that will not work perfectly.

> \'What\'s the point of these anti-drunk driving ad campaigns? People are still going to drink and drive no matter what.\'

### Relativist Fallacy

Rejecting a claim because of a belief that truth is relative to a person or group.

> \'That\'s perhaps true for you, but it\'s not true for me.\'

### Spotlight

Assuming an observation from a small sample size applies to an entire group.

> \'This large shoe manufacturer employs children in sweatshops. Therefore all shoe companies are evil child-slave owners!\'

### Sweeping Generalization

Applying a general rule too broadly.

> \'Those young men rioted because they lacked morally responsible fathers.\'

### Undistributed Middle

Assuming because two things share a property, that makes them the same thing.

> \'A theory can mean an unproven idea. Scientists use the term \'the Theory of Evolution\', therefore evolution is an unproven idea.\'

---

## Garbled Cause &amp; Effect

### Affirming the Consequent

Assuming there\'s only one explanation for the observation you\'re making.

> \'Marriage often results in the birth of children, so that\'s the only reason why it exists.\'

### Circular Logic

A conclusion is derived from premises based on the conclusion.

> \'Stripping privacy rights only matters to those with something to hide. You must have something to hide if you oppose stripping privacy rights.\'

### Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc

Claiming two events that occur together must have a cause-and-effect relationship. Also known as \'Confusing Causation with Correlation\'

> \'Teenagers in gangs listen to rap music with violent themes. Rap music inspires violence in teenagers.\'

### Denying the Antecedent

There isn\'t only one explanation for an outcome, so it\'s false to assume the cause based on the effect.

> \'If you get a degree, you\'ll get a good job. If you don\'t get a degree, you won\'t get a good job.\'

### Ignoring a Common Cause

Claiming one event must have caused the other when a third (unseen) event is probably the cause.

> \'We had the 60s sexual revolution, and now people are dying of AIDS.\'

### Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc

Claiming that because one event follows another, it was also caused by it.

> \'Since the election of the President, more people than ever are unemployed, therefore the President has damaged the economy.\'

### Two Wrongs Make a Right

Assuming that if one wrong is committed, another wrong will cancel it out.

> \'Sure - the conditions in this prison are cruel and dehumanizing, but these inmates are criminals!\'

---

## Manipulating Content

### Ad Hoc Rescue

Trying to save a cherished belief by repeatedly revising the argument to explain away problems.

> \'But apart from better sanitation, medicine, education, irrigation, public health, roads, a freshwater system and public order.. What have the Romans done for us?\'

### Begging the Question

Hiding other contributory factors and supporting the truth of your claim without any evidence other than the conclusion of your claim.

> \'All illegal drugs are harmful - that\'s why they\'re illegal.\'

### Biased Generalization

Generalizing from an unrepresentative sample to increase the strength of your argument.

> \'Our website poll found that 90% of internet users oppose online piracy laws.\'

### Confirmation Bias

Looking only for evidence that supports your argument while ignoring contradicting evidence.

> \'It\'s obvious – 9/11 was an American-government led conspiracy to justify the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. No plane hit the Pentagon. The Twin Towers collapse was a controlled demolition… etc.\'

### False Dilemma

Presenting two opposing options as the two options while hiding alternatives.

> \'We\'re going to have to cut the education budget or go deeper into debt. We can\'t afford to go deeper into debt, so we\'ll have to cut the education budget.\'

### Lie

An outright untruth repeated knowingly as a fact.

> \'I did not have sexual relations with that woman.\'

### Misleading Vividness

Describing an occurrence in vivid detail, even if it is a rare occurrence, to convince someone that it is a true.

> \'After legalizing gay marriage, school libraries were required to stock same-sex literature; primary school children were given homosexual fairy tales and even manuals of explicit homosexual advocacy.\'

### Red Herring

Introducing irrelevant material to the argument to distract and lead towards a different conclusion.

> \'Why should the senator account for irregularities in his expenses? After all, there are senators who have done far worse things.\'

### Slippery Slope

Assuming a relatively small first step will inevitably lead to a chain of related (negative) events.

> \'If we legalize marijuana, more people will start using crack and heroin, then we\'d have to legalize those too.\'

### Suppressed Evidence

Intentionally failing to use significant and relevant information which counts against one\'s own conclusion.

> \'This Iraqi regime possesses and produces chemical and biological weapons. It is seeking nuclear weapons.\'

### Unfalsifiability

Offering a claim that cannot be proven false, because there is no way to check if it is false or not.

> \'He lied because he\'s possessed by demons.\'

---

## On the Attack

### Ad Hominem

Bypassing the argument by launching an irrelevant attack on the person rather than their claim.

> \'Anyone that says we should build the Ground Zero Mosque is an American-hating liberal.\'

### Burden of Proof

I don\'t need to prove my claim - you must prove it is false.

> \'I maintain long-term solar cycles are the cause of global warming. Show me I\'m wrong.\'

### Circumstantial Ad Hominem

Stating a claim isn\'t credible only because of the advocate\'s interest in their claim.

> \'A study into the health risks of mobile phones involved mobile phone companies, therefore the study cannot be trusted.\'

### Genetic Fallacy

Attacking the cause or origin of a claim, rather than it\'s substance.

> \'Of course, mainstream liberal media aren\'t going to say Barack Obama is a Muslim.\'

### Guilt by Association

Discrediting an idea or claim by associating it with an undesirable person or group.

> \'Oh you want to relax the anti-terrorism laws just like the terrorists want us to do. Are you saying you support terrorism?\'

### Straw Man

Creating a distorted or simplified caricature of your opponent\'s argument, and the arguing against that.

> \'You say Israel should stop building settlements on the West Bank in violation of the treaty, so you\'re saying Israel doesn\'t have the right to be a nation?\'
